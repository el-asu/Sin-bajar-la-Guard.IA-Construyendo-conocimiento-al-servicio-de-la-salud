This project was developed as part of my “Diploma in Data Science, Machine Learning, and its Applications” at the University of Córdoba (FaMAF - UNC, Argentina).

The project focuses on understanding the relationship between Argentina’s healthcare system resources and the causes of death across its different provinces.

Key aspects of the project include:
	•	Data cleaning
 
	•	Exploratory data analysis

 	•	Supervised learning models
	
 	•	Unsupervised learning models
	
 	•	Development of a web app that helps users find the nearest healthcare center based on the required specialty.
